On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n","\n",">One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.  Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n","\n",">In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.

That is, it is used in estimating empirical values of the parameters in a qualitative response model. The probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled, as a function of the explanatory (predictor) variables, using a logistic function. Frequently (and subsequently in this article) \"logistic regression\" is used to refer specifically to the problem in which the dependent variable is binary—that is, the number of available categories is two—and problems with more than two categories are referred to as multinomial logistic regression or, if the multiple categories are ordered, as ordered logistic regression.\n","Logistic regression measures the relationship between a categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables, which are usually (but not necessarily) continuous, by using probability scores as the predicted values of the dependent variable.[1] As such it treats the same set of problems as does probit regression using similar techniques.\n","\n","#### The skinny, as explained by yours truly:\n","Our competition wants us to predict a binary outcome. That is, it wants to know whether some will die, (represented as a 0), or survive, (represented as 1). A good place to start is to calculate the probability that an individual observation, or person, is likely to be a 0 or 1. That way we would know the chance that someone survives, and could start making somewhat informed predictions. If we did, we'd get results like this:: \n","\n","![pred](https://raw.github.com/agconti/kaggle-titanic/master/images/calc_prob.png) \n","\n","(*Y axis is the probability that someone survives, X axis is the passenger’s number from 1 to 891.*)\n","\n","While that information is useful it doesn’t let us know whether someone ended up alive or dead. It just lets us know the chance that they will survive or die. We still need to translate these probabilities into the binary decision we’re looking for. But how? We could arbitrarily say that our survival cutoff is anyone with a probability of survival over 50%. In fact, this tactic would actually perform pretty well for our data and would allow you to make decently accurate predictions. Graphically it would look something like this:\n","\n","![predwline](https://raw.github.com/agconti/kaggle-titanic/master/images/calc_prob_wline.png)\n","\n","If you’re a betting man like me, you don’t like to leave everything to chance. What are the odds that setting that cutoff at 50% works? Maybe 20% or 80% would work better. Clearly we need a more exact way to make that cutoff. What can save the day? In steps the **Logistic Regression**. \n","\n","A logistic regression follows the all steps we took above but mathematically calculates the cutoff, or decision boundary (as stats nerds call it), for you. This way it can figure out the best cut off to choose, perhaps 50% or 51.84%, that most accurately represents the training data.\n","\n","The three cells below show the process of creating our Logitist regression model, training it on the data, and examining its performance. \n","\n","First, we define our formula for our Logit regression. In the next cell we create a regression friendly dataframe that sets up boolean values for the categorical variables in our formula and lets our regression model know the types of inputs we're giving it. The model is then instantiated and fitted before a summary of the model's performance is printed. In the last cell we graphically compare the predictions of our model to the actual values we are trying to predict, as well as the residual errors from our model to check for any structure we may have missed."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"pirguwylzy1D"},"outputs":[],"source":["# model formula\n","# here the ~ sign is an = sign, and the features of our dataset\n","# are written as a formula to predict survived.

We've all guess how many gumballs are in that jar at one time or another, and odds are not a single one of us guessed exactly right. Interestingly though, while each of our individual guesses for probably were wrong, the average of all of the guesses, if there were enough, usually comes out to be pretty close to the actual number of gumballs in the jar. Crazy, I know.  This idea is that clever statistical observation that lets random forests work.\n","\n","**How do they work?** A random forest algorithm randomly generates many extremely simple models to explain the variance observed in random subsections of our data.  These models are like our gumball guesses. They are all awful individually. Really awful. But once they are averaged, they can be powerful predictive tools. The averaging step is the secret sauce. While the vast majority of those models were extremely poor; they were all as bad as each other on average. So when their predictions are averaged together, the bad ones average their effect on our model out to zero. The thing that remains, *if anything*, is one or a handful of those models have stumbled upon the true structure of the data.\n","The cell below shows the process of instantiating and fitting a random forest, generating predictions form the resulting model, and then scoring the results."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kOm1SsXezy1T"},"outputs":[],"source":["# import the machine learning library that holds the randomforest\n","import sklearn.ensemble as ske\n","\n","# Create the random forest model and fit the model to our training data\n","y, x = dmatrices(formula_ml, data=df, return_type='dataframe')\n","# RandomForestClassifier expects a 1 demensional NumPy array, so we convert\n","y = np.asarray(y).ravel()\n","#instantiate and fit our model\n","results_rf = ske.RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100).fit(x, y)\n","\n","# Score the results\n","score = results_rf.score(x, y)\n","print(\"Mean accuracy of Random Forest Predictions on the data was: {0}\".format(score))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"60UuHSFUzy1T"},"source":["Our random forest performed only slightly better than a thumb wave, meaning that if you randomly assigned 1s and 0s by waving your thumb up and down you would do almost as well on average.
